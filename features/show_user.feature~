  As an Adminstrator who wants to track users
  I want to see all users

Background:
    Given the following users exist:
      | login    | password       |  admin  |
      | aser     | passwordaser   |  true   |
      | ahmed    | passwordahmed  |  false  |


Scenario: Show users

Given I am on the homepage
    When I follow "Sign-up"
    And I fill in "Login" with "aser"
    And I fill in "Password" with "passwordaser"
    And I fill in "Password confirmation" with "passwordaser"
    And I check "Admin"
    And I press "Create User"
    And I follow "Home"
    And I follow "Add A Car"
 #   Then I should be on the homepage
    And I fill in "car_brand" with "Toyota"
