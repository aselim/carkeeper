Feature: display list of cars sorted by different criteria
 
  As a person looking for a used car
  So that I can quickly browse cars based on my preferences
  I want to see cars sorted by brand

Background: cars have been added to database
  
  Given the following cars exist:
  | brand     | carmodel | year  |
  | Toyota    | Lexus    | 2000  |
  | Honda     | Civic    | 2005  |
  | Fiat      | 128      | 1995  |

And I am on the home page

Scenario: sort cars by brand
When I follow "Brand"
Then I should see "Fiat" before "Honda"


########

Scenario: sort movies in increasing order of release date
Given I check the following ratings: G, PG, PG-13, NC-17, R
When I press "ratings_submit"
And I follow "Release Date"
Then I should see "2001: A Space Odyssey" before "Raiders of the Lost Ark"
And I should see "Raiders of the Lost Ark" before "The Terminator"
And I should see "The Terminator" before "When Harry Met Sally"
And I should see "When Harry Met Sally" before "Aladdin"
And I should see "Aladdin" before "Chicken Run"
And I should see "Chicken Run" before "Chocolat"
And I should see "Chocolat" before "Amelie"
And I should see "Amelie" before "The Incredibles"
And I should see "The Incredibles" before "The Help"
#Then I should see "2001: A Space Odyssey"
#And I should see "Raiders of the Lost Ark"
#And I should see "The Terminator"
#And I should see "When Harry Met Sally"
#And I should see "Aladdin"
#And I should see "Chicken Run"
#And I should see "Chocolat"
#And I should see "Amelie"
#And I should see "The Incredibles"
#And I should see "The Help"
